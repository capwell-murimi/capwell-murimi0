  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am an entry-level data enthusiast with hands-on experience in data analysis and engineering. I enjoy working with data and learning how to turn numbers into insights.
  </p>
  <p>
    My skills include using Python, SQL, and tools like Pandas for cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data. I am comfortable building simple data pipelines and working with spreadsheets and BI tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am eager to keep learning, improve my technical abilities, and collaborate with others on real-world data projects. I believe in clear communication, teamwork, and always being curious.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I like exploring new tech, reading, and connecting with other learners in the data community. If you'd like to connect or work together, feel free to <a href="mailto:capwellmurimi@gmail.com">reach out</a>!
